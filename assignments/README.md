1. Create one simple Flask application with sample routings.

2. Implement one flask route e.g. `/login/<username>`. Implement 2 more methods namely `success()` and `failed()`. If username is say "john" then redirection to success method will happen else to failed method.  

3. Create login method with proper routing. Login form should have 2 inputs e.g. username and password. Provide appropriate validations for the form, after successful login show success message using one template and for error use another template. As of now you can hardcode values for valid username/password credential.
